# CST8152-Compiler

Introduction to the basic principles, techniques, and tools used to translate text expressed in one language to equivalent text expressed in another language. The concepts discussed and the programming concepts studied in previous courses are applied to develop and program the front-end of a simple compiler or interpreter using ANSI C as implementation language.

•	Used regular expressions with a transition table to create a finite state machine\
•	Implemented a lexical analyzer(scanner) to read the source file character by character for token recognition.\
•	Made transformations to the Platypus grammar by fixing immediate left recursion and by left factoring where necessary.\
•	Created the FIRST and FOLLOW sets for grammar\
•	Implemented a syntax analyzer(parser) using the fixed grammar.
